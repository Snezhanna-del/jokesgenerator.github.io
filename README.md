The description of the project for 'Funny Bot'
I've created a page where a user can go to. On my page I provide a user jokes where user can choose between two options jokes about designers or developers. After user decided which joke he/she wants to see, he/she can chosen another joke from the same category or leave the popup with joke by clicking on "no" button. Then use has a new choice for a joke category. If user clicks on the same joke category the new joke from the chosen category will be executed.

To execute my page, you need to download my files. My files consist of index.html, app.css and app.js.
